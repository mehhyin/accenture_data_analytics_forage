# Background 

Based on the background information, Social Buzz is a social media platform where they want:

- To merge all their datasets
- To have an analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity

## Task
I have merged all the datasets, cleaned and visualise the data using python.
